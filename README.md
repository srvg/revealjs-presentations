# the Revelator

Relevator generates Reveal JS presentation decks from simplified (and easier to edit) YAML files.
Upstream project https://github.com/mpdehaan/revelator

## Background

Reveal.js is a pretty awesome framework for generating web-based slides.
This is what Reveal.js looks like: http://lab.hakim.se/reveal-js/#/

HTML you write typically looks like: https://github.com/hakimel/reveal.js/blob/master/index.html

Except with Revelator, you can write simpler things like: https://github.com/mpdehaan/slide-the-revelator/blob/master/test.yml

Which is more the way I want to compose and tweak slides.
